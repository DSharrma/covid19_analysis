--========================================
--Problems:
--there are some rows where new_vaccinations are not acknowledged
--columns like total_vaccinations is not continuous, only static data points

--Solutions
--create columns with filled down data points
--have to create custom interval columns
--========================================

--we can kill 2 birds with 1 stone here and save this result in a temp table
--then join the temp table with the main table to create a single result
--this result is to create a view for import to visualization platform
