# covid19_analysis
This is basically my first exploratory data analysis that I have done and uploaded to Github.
It is about Covid 19; specifically the number of cases, death toll, number of vaccinations along with the other data in there which I have not used.
I downloaded the dataset from https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv which I got from https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/coronavirus-data-explorer
I have done some EDA with SQL and prepared a view to be used in a Power BI dashboard which I will share as well.
In future, I also plan on doing a more statistical analysis of the data using R Programming which I will share here as well.
I am still learning Python but once I get good enough I might try to do a statistical analysis with Python as well.
